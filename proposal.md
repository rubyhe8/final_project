## Director, Genre and Duration: The Secret to Higher Film Ratings

## Motivation

We are a group of passionate movie enthusiasts who are eager to dive
into the Letterboxd dataset to uncover fascinating insights about films.
In an era dominated by short-form content and claims of shorter
attention spans, we are curious to see if shorter movies tend to receive
higher ratings. We also want to explore the secret formulas behind
top-rated films: Do certain directors excel when they stick to a
specific genre or keep their films under 90 minutes? Beyond that, we are
excited to analyze trends in genre preferences and discover what kind of
film would captivate audiences.
