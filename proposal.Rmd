### Motivation 
We are a group of passionate movie enthusiasts who are eager to dive into the Letterboxd dataset to uncover fascinating insights about films. In an era dominated by short-form content and claims of shorter attention spans, we are curious to see if shorter movies tend to receive higher ratings. We also want to explore the secret formulas behind top-rated films: Do certain directors excel when they stick to a specific genre or keep their films under 90 minutes? Beyond that, we are excited to analyze trends in genre preferences and discover what kind of film would captivate audiences. 

### Final Deliverables 


### Data Source 

We will be using this [Letterbox Movie Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilislam007/letterbox-movie-classification-dataset) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It has 10,002 observations with 17 variables. Variables that we may be interested in investigating include genre, director, runtime, rating, watches, and likes.
